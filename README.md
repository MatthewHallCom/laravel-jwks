Provide libraries to help you deal with JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) in Laravel üòâ

## Supports
- Laravel 10+
- PHP 8+
- **RSA** algorithm only (for now)

## Sample use cases

Ever thinking of microservices? One of the biggest challenges is the Authentication & Authorization.

However, you don't have to spend enormous time to build a brand new AuthService and migrate the current users.

Your current app = the core, the heart of everything. Let's build satellite services around that.

With JWKS, satellite services can simply verify the signed JWT token before handling the actual requests.

JWKS is supported in multiple languages e.g.: Node.js, go,...

## Installation

Install the library:

```bash
composer require shipsaas/laravel-jwks
